## Issues

### Project

- I need to separate the selects in `IngredientsForm.js` into an array generated by a function or class for testing.

- I need to asses splitting instructions into its own component from `RecipesForm.js`.

- What could I put in Utilities? Keep a running list?

  - Submit Buttons

  - Landing page section constructor

-

#### Stateful Components

- The values in `RecipesForm` needs to change if editing a recipe vs. creating one.

### Workflow

- I need to set up my Ubuntu to use SSH keys for git and Zeit builds.

- I want a tree alias that automatically excludes node_modules
