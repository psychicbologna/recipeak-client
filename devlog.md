# Development Log

## 2019-10-16

- `RecipeCard` and `RecipeCardList` are go. `Recipe` is all that's left, will integrate this implementation with `Ingredients` in the backend.

- Passing context for recipelist, need to finish `RecipeCard` object to complete generated list.

- Tomorrow, must implement route methods in backend to have full functionality and test all the calls.

## 2019-10-14

- Structure of the components planned and staged.

- Form components fleshed out in JSX.

- Express boilerplate for backend created and uploaded to github.

## Issues

### Project

- I need to separate the selects in `IngredientsForm.js` into an array generated by a function or class for testing.

- I need to asses splitting instructions into its own component from `RecipesForm.js` in a later version.

- What could I put in Utilities? Keep a running list?

  - Submit Buttons

  - Landing page section constructor

  - Arrays for each of the form inputs and select fields.

#### Stateful Components

- The values in `RecipesForm` needs to change if editing a recipe vs. creating one.

### Workflow

- I need to set up my Ubuntu to use SSH keys for git and Zeit builds.
